## Things I Learned

- Using fetch in JavaScript to interact with REST APIs
- Backpopulating a form with values when editing an object
- Working with Promises in JavaScript
- Building a fullstack web application!!! (I'm really proud of myself haha)

## Things I Could've Improved

- This was my first time building a frontend, so my JS really needs some work
- Spending more time in the design phase since I needed to refactor a good chunch of my code midway through development due to poorly designed API endpoints
- Documenting and commenting more while coding, rather than going back and adding in comments later
- Spending less time on design when building an mvp is the priority
